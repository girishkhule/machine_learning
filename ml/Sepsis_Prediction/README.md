# Sepsis_Prediction
Sepsis is a serious medical condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Early detection and prediction of sepsis is critical to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality. Machine learning techniques can be used to analyze patient data and identify patterns that indicate an increased risk of sepsis, allowing for early intervention and treatment. A sepsis prediction project would aim to develop and implement a machine learning-based system for monitoring patients and identifying those at risk of developing sepsis. This could be done by analyzing vital signs, laboratory results, and other patient data to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of sepsis. The ultimate goal of the project would be to improve patient outcomes and reduce sepsis-related deaths.
